# Investing-in-Nashville-Logistic-Regression-Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-Gradient-Boost

Problem:

You just started working for a real estate company and they are looking to make a huge investment into the growing Nashville area. Theyâ€™ve acquired a dataset about recent sales and want to see if you can help them find discrepancies in the market. By looking at the variable, Sale Price Compared To Value, that will help us see which properties are being over/under valued. If we can build an accurate model, this could help the company identify what the key factors in finding the best deal may be.

Part 1:

Use proper data cleansing techniques to ensure that you have the highest quality data to model this problem. Detail your process and discuss the decisions you made to clean the data.

Part 2:

Build a logistic regression model to accurately predict housing prices and determine what is driving those prices.

Part 3:

Build a decision tree model and compare the results with the results of the previous model.

Part 4:

Build a Random Forest model and compare the results with the results of the previous models.

Part 5:

Build a Gradient Boost model and compare the results with the results of the previous models.

Part 6:

Use multiple benchmarking metrics to compare and contrast the four models. Based on your findings, provide evidence of which model you believe the real estate company should use.
